## Adding the Bot

To add Processor to your discord server, you can click [this invite link.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689678745782714464&scope=bot&permissions=2134371583) You must have the **Manage Server** permission to invite this bot to your desired server.

## Getting Started

The prefix for this bot is `/`. Yes, it's a slash (/), since slash commands are the future for Discord bots! Type `/help` to list all the categories of commands. You will need to set up the correct permissions for the bot. For your convenience, you may give this bot `Administrator` privileges as it resolves all permission conflicts with the bot.

- `meme` Shows a random picture of a meme from Reddit.
- `image avatar [user]` Shows a random picture of the thing specified, if given.
